# ShipBob Case Study
### Denny Kang

Hello, and thank you for your time in reviewing the work I have done for the Data Engineering case study.

In this repository, you will find the code I have written to tackle the problem.

The full output, including all written code and image output, can be seen in the shipbob_case_study.md file located in this repository.

For your convenience, I have also included copies of the .py and .ipynb files that I used to generate the analysis.

Due to file size considerations, I have not uploaded copies of the cleaned_tweets.csv, tweets.txt, or the report_tweets.csv files generated along the process. I have also not included the config.py file, which contains my Twitter API token and keys. 

If you have any questions about my work, please feel free to reach out via email.

Thanks,
Denny
